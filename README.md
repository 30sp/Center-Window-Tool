1. Download and install [AutoHotkey v1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe). If you already have latest version of AutoHotkey installed, AutoHotkey may ask you to also install v1.1. You can install it without any issues.
2. Download the download the source code from the [latest release](https://github.com/30sp/Center-Window-Tool/releases/latest).
3. Find and run the `Installer.exe` file in the downloaded folder. It may ask for administrative privileges. If you don't trust the installer, you can run the `Installer.ahk` file instead.
4. It will add itself to the Startups folder so that it starts automatically when you log in to your computer. If you don't want this, you can remove it from the Startups folder.

> [!NOTE]
> You can find Startups folder by pressing `Win + R` and typing `shell:startup`.

> [!WARNING]
> The installer may not work due to the security settings of your computer. If you encounter any issues, you can run the `Installer.ahk` file instead.

> [!NOTE]
> You can remove the source code folder after installation.
