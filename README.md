## Introduction
The Center Window Tool is a utility that allows you to center a window on your screen. It can be useful when working with multiple windows and you want to easily position them in the center of your screen.

## Installation
1. Download and install [AutoHotkey v1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe). If you already have latest version of AutoHotkey installed, AutoHotkey may ask you to also install v1.1. You can install it without any issues.
2. Download the `Center Window.exe` file from the [latest release](/releases/latest).
3. Run the `Center Window.exe` file as administrator.
4. It will add itself to the Startups folder so that it starts automatically when you log in to your computer. If you don't want this, you can remove it from the Startups folder.

> [!NOTE]
> You can find Startups folder by pressing `Win + R` and typing `shell:startup`.

## Usage
